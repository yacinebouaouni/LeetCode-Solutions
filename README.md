# Ideas

## Sliding Window
* In a fixed length setting, try to update the quantity of interest (currentSum, Product ...) by adding and substracting. Don't compute the quantity from zero.
* In a fixed length setting, only one pointer is enough
* In a sliding window, try using one pointer that is incremented +1 in a for loop and the second incremented when a condition is reached (e.g., max consicutive ones problem). Then stop incrementation when the condition is satisfied again.

## Stack
* Sometimes it's necessary to save the intermediate operations in the stack to be processed again just like [Decode String](./Stack/decode_string.py) problem.

## Queues
* Some problem require two queues to compare the oldest occurences of each class like [Dota2 Senate]()

## Linked Lists
* Reversing a LL requires 3 pointers: current, next and previous
* Sometimes you need to reverse a LL to 


## Binary Tree
* When using a DFS with a BT sometimes you need extra variables in the recursive function like `count` or `sup` in [Count Good Nodes in binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/description/). These variables can be returned in one way or another by the recursive function.
* When you need to return a value like `the longest path` using a DFS, it's a good strategy to use a class attribute to keep track of that variable. (Check [Longest Zigzag Path in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/description/) and [Lowest Common Ancestor]())
* It's helpful to use extra variables as arguments of the DFS function when we have multiple choices like either go left or right. (Check [Longest Zigzag Path in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/description/))
* Be careful, sometime the call stack of the DFS is equal to the height of the tree which is log2(N) when it's balanced and N worst case.
* In some problems, you need to first return the value for both left and right DFS then do the computation for the current node (Check [Lowest Common Ancestor]())
### BT BFS
* It's more convenient and optimal to use an iterative approach with BFS
* Doing computations on each level is possible by saving the length of the queue and then looping on that length and adding children. This insures that we loop only through the elements of the present level.
