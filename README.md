# Ideas

## Sliding Window
* In a fixed length setting, try to update the quantity of interest (currentSum, Product ...) by adding and substracting. Don't compute the quantity from zero.
* In a fixed length setting, only one pointer is enough
* In a sliding window, try using one pointer that is incremented +1 in a for loop and the second incremented when a condition is reached (e.g., max consicutive ones problem). Then stop incrementation when the condition is satisfied again.

## Stack
* Sometimes it's necessary to save the intermediate operations in the stack to be processed again just like [Decode String](./Stack/decode_string.py) problem.

## Queues
* Some problem require two queues to compare the oldest occurences of each class like [Dota2 Senate]()

## Linked Lists
* Reversing a LL requires 3 pointers: current, next and previous
* Sometimes you need to reverse a LL to 


## Binary Tree
* When using a DFS with a BT sometimes you need extra variables in the recursive function like `count` or `sup` in [Count Good Nodes in binary tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-nodes-in-binary-tree/description/). These variables can be returned in one way or another by the recursive function.
* When you need to return a value like `the longest path` using a DFS, it's a good strategy to use a class attribute to keep track of that variable. (Check [Longest Zigzag Path in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/description/) and [Lowest Common Ancestor]())
* It's helpful to use extra variables as arguments of the DFS function when we have multiple choices like either go left or right. (Check [Longest Zigzag Path in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-zigzag-path-in-a-binary-tree/description/))
* Be careful, sometime the call stack of the DFS is equal to the height of the tree which is log2(N) when it's balanced and N worst case.
* In some problems, you need to first return the value for both left and right DFS then do the computation for the current node (Check [Lowest Common Ancestor]())

### BT BFS
* It's more convenient and optimal to use an iterative approach with BFS
* Doing computations on each level is possible by saving the length of the queue and then looping on that length and adding children. This insures that we loop only through the elements of the present level.


### Binary Search Tree
* You need to take advantage of the property of the BST by dividing the search space by two and reducing complexity to log n.


## Bit Manipulation
* In python it might be helpful to use the function `bin` to compute binary representation
* Kernighan's Algorithm (number & number-1) is used for counting set bits in O(log n)
* XOR can be used to compare two numbers. It has a property where a xor a = 0. Thus, it helps solving problems with missing value [Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/).


## Intervals
* It's often usefull to sort the intervals by start or by end (sometimes both work).
* A greedy approach works well with problems that detect overlapping intervals like [Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons]() and [Non Overlapping Intervals](). This approach works by iterating through intervals and comparing something like start with previous end and update the previous end accordingly.
* After 4 medium problems and 1 hard it's pretty clear that we always need sorting. Sometimes sort by interval size like in [Minimum Interval to Include Each Query](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-interval-to-include-each-query/description/).
* Binary search can be used when we have intervals and another set of queries, but it's a less efficient approach => Future Work: Use Heap


## Heap
* In problems like [Maximum Subsequence Score]() it's usefull to zip and sort the two arrays. The sorting order is important.
* When we try to track the minimum in two sides of an array => Use two heaps

## Dynamic Programming
* Some problems are easier to solve in a bottom-up approach (iterative) and other in a top-down approach (recursive).
* The bottom-up approach is based on tabulation. It starts with base case, iterates, saves results in a table and continue.

## Backtracking
* Sometimes it's usefull to add a condition to stop backtracking early like when you don't have enough elements to finish a combination of a certain length [Combinations]()
* Some problems in combinatorics have a complexity of "catalan numbers" O(Cn). Check this problem [Generate Parenthesis](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/) 

## Math
* To compute PGCD use the function math.gcd(x1,x2)


## Monotonic Stack
* This stack is monotonic (decreasing or increasing). It serves in problems where we are looking for the next largest or lowest element in a list.
* It's often helpful to store the index of the elements alongside its value in the monotonic stack to compute for example the span.
